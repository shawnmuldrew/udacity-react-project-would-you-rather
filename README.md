# Would you Rather Project

A question and answer application project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 

This application allows you to ask and answer questions posed by users.

Screens:
* Dashboard - Lists all questions in two tabs: Unanswered and Answered
* New Question - Allows user to ask a new question
* Question Poll - Allows user to answer a question
* Question Results - Shows the results of all the current answers to a question

## Running the Application

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the application with `npm start`

## Important
The database is simulated by an initial load of data from a file (_DATA.js) and two 
database APIs: saveQuestion and saveQuestionAnswer.
